The College has a dedicated three-storied building with a total area of 1800 sqm, 
for the exclusive use of Library and Postgraduate Research facilities. 
The College library has 69,227 books, 14,857 reference titles and 165 journals 
(including IEEE Journals along with full access to Digital Libraries of IEEE, ASME, ASCE etc.) 
that cater to all the seven branches of engineering, as well as other disciplines.
The College has a Centre for Student Services and Placement, which gives personal and career counseling to the students. 
The idea is to enable students to effectively cope with life at College as well as in their career. One of the major objectives of the centre is to help students in obtaining internships and placements in reputed companies across various industrial sectors. Assistance is also provided to students in procuring higher education opportunities. 
The College offers special coaching for GATE, TOEFL, and GRE to its students. 
They are also encouraged to present technical papers at seminars in other colleges with a view to improving their research and presentation skills. Also, during the last few years, several personality development programs have been conducted by experts from industry.
